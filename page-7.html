              protection for personal and confidential information that are not less stringent than the standards

              accordance with the Standard Contractual Clauses as set forth in Section 13 of this Privacy Policy, the
              Privacy Shield Framework (to which Simplify still adheres) and other applicable law. Such third-party
              companies are authorized to use your personal data only as necessary to provide these services to us
              and/or you and for the purposes for which the personal data was collected. Personal data may be
              transferred to third parties outside the state, province, country or other jurisdiction in which Simplify
              stores personal data, subject to Simplify taking steps to provide that any such transfer is made in full
              compliance with applicable laws. In the case of partners with whom you contract directly, their policies
              regarding personal data will govern your relationship with them as stated in the applicable agreement
              between you and the partner and we will not be responsible for any actions or omission of these partners.
              Under the Standard Contractual Clauses and Privacy Shield Principles, you have the right to opt out of (i)
              disclosures of your personal data to third parties; or (ii) uses of your personal data for a purpose that
              is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently
              authorized by you.</p>

            <h3>3. Access to Personal Data Controlled by Simplify</h3>
            <p>Upon request and within 30 days, or as otherwise required by applicable law, Simplify will provide you
              with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal data.
              In addition, Simplify will take reasonable steps to permit customers to correct, amend, delete, or receive
              a copy of their personal data. To request this access, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@simplifycareers.com">privacy@simplifycareers.com</a>. In accordance with customer
              agreements, Simplify will, upon request, provide our customers with a copy of their personal data stored
              by Simplify upon expiration or termination of the customer agreements, unless applicable law determines
              otherwise.</p>
            <h3>4. Access to Personal Data, Including Biometric Data, Controlled by our Customers</h3>
            <p>Simplify acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal data and to withdraw consent to the
              use/processing of your personal data. In most cases, Simplify has no direct relationship with the
              individuals whose personal data it processes for customers. We recommend that an individual who seeks
              access, or who seeks to correct, amend, delete or receive a copy of personal data should direct his/her
              query to the Simplify customer (the data controller).</p>
            <p>Simplify customers may collect, store and process biometric data of candidates or individuals, including
              without limitation fingerprint, retinal and facial recognition data using Simplify supplied equipment
              and/or Services. Simplify customers and/or their end users are solely responsible for compliance with any
              applicable biometric data protection laws including, without limitation, obtaining legally required
              consents and providing legally required notices and/or opt-out/in requirements to such individuals. The
              use of any Simplify Service by customers or their end users does not guarantee compliance with applicable
              biometric data protection laws. If you are a candidate or individual of one of our customers or their end
              users and have any questions or requests or objections related to the collection, storage and processing
              of your biometric data, please contact the customer or end user that you interact with directly.If
              requested to remove data by our customer, we will respond within 30 days or as otherwise required by
              applicable law. Individuals may also submit such inquiries or requests directly to Simplify at no cost for
              them by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@simplifycareers.com">privacy@simplifycareers.com</a>.</p>
            <h3>5. Data Retention by Simplify</h3>
            <p>We will retain personal data including biometric data for as long as a customer’s account is active or as
              needed to provide the Service to our customer, as required under customer agreements and / or for as long
              as Simplify needs the personal data to fulfill the purposes for which the Company initially collected it,
              unless otherwise required by applicable law or court order. We will also retain this personal data as
              necessary to comply with our legal and/or contractual obligations, comply with court orders, resolve
              disputes, and enforce our agreements. When the purpose for which Simplify is processing the personal data
              is fulfilled, expires or is terminated, Simplify will delete (or render unusable) any personal data in
              accordance with our customer agreements, this Privacy Policy and applicable law. In the event we cannot
              delete your personal data or render it unusable, we will inform you of the reasons, subject to any legal
              restrictions.</p>
            <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
            <p>Simplify employs reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and
              alteration of the personal data it processes. When the Service is accessed using Microsoft Internet
              Explorer versions 8.0 or higher, Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology protects information using both
              server authentication and data encryption to help provide that personal data is safe, and secure while in
              transit. Simplify also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session
              identifications, and hosts the Service in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other
              advanced technology to protect against interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Simplify
              provides individual usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These
              safeguards help protect against unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and provide for the
              appropriate use of personal data. Nevertheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
              electronic storage, is one hundred percent (100%) secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute
              security. If you have any questions about security on our Service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@simplifycareers.com">privacy@simplifycareers.com</a>.</p>
            <h3>7. Links to Third Party Sites</h3>
            <p>Our Service includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those at <a href="https://www.themetablue.com/" target="_blank">https://www.themetablue.com</a>. If you submit
              personal data to any of these sites, your information is governed by the applicable third-party’s privacy
              policies and we are not responsible for it. We therefore encourage you to carefully read any notices
              provided through a hyperlink and the privacy policy of any Web site you visit and raise questions directly
              with these other providers.</p>
            <h3>8. No Services for Minors</h3>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect information from minors. To use the Site, you must be the age of legal
              majority in your place of residence. By using the Site, you hereby represent that you are at least the age
              of legal majority in your place of residence. We do not use an application or other mechanism to determine
              the age of users of the Site. All information provided to us will be treated as if it was provided by an
              adult. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete information associated with a minor as soon
              as practicable if we learn that a minor has submitted information about himself/herself to us.</p>
            <h3>9. Note for California Residents</h3>
            <p>California law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), permits California
              residents who provide us with personal information to request certain information including the categories
              of personal information we collect, the sources from which your personal information is collected, how we
              use your personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we share your personal
              information, and whether we sell your personal information or otherwise disclose such information to third
              parties for their direct marketing purposes. See Sections 1 and 2 above for the categories of personal
              information we collect, the sources of such information and how we use your personal information. To
              request access to or deletion of your personal information, please contact the Company’s Data Protection
              Officers. See Section 14 for contact details. We do not, at this time, sell your personal information or
              disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Accordingly, no
              opt out is necessary at this time. Although we currently do not sell your personal information, if you
              would still like to record your opt-out, you may do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@simplifycareers.com">privacy@simplifycareers.com</a>. If we change this policy, we
              will update this Section and provide instructions on how you may make a request for details regarding the
              sale of your personal information. While we do not sell your personal information, we may share your
              personal information for “business purpose[s]” (as defined in the CCPA) with third parties. We will only
              share your personal information with third parties in the ways that are described in our customer
              agreements and this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3>10. Do-Not-Track Disclosure</h3>
            <p>There are many methods where web browser signals and similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to
              disable tracking. But we may not be aware of or able to honor every such mechanism. Because there is not
              yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals other than
              cookies, we may not respond to undefined DNT signals to our Sites or online services. More information
              about “do not track” is available at<a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>
              concerning such information.</p>
            <h3>11. Severability</h3>
            <p>The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Privacy Policy in any country shall not
              affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, which shall remain in
              full force and effect.</p>
            <h3>12. Changes in this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices that will become
              effective upon posting. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or
              by means of a notice through the Service prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to
              periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
            <h3>13. Data Protection Officers</h3>
            <p>Simplify has appointed Data Protection Officers, who are responsible for matters relating to data privacy
              and protection. The Data Protection Officers can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@simplifycareers.com">privacy@simplifycareers.com</a>, or by mail at: Simplify
              Workforce Inc., 10 Exchange Place, Jersey City, NJ 07302, Attn: Data Protection Officer, Legal.</p>
            <p>Any questions or complaints concerning Simplify Careers’ Privacy Policy or handling of personal data can
              be directed to: <a href="mailto:privacy@simplifycareers.com">privacy@simplifycareers.com</a>&nbsp;or
              Simplify Workforce Inc., 10 Exchange Place, Jersey City, NJ 07302. In addition, you have the right to
