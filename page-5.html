                precedence, as identified in Section 2.</li>
              <li>Some of the products and services that Simplify offers are governed by supplemental terms. If you use
                any of these products and services, supplemental terms will be made available and will become a part of

              <li>If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full
                force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any
                amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.</li>

                expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek
                disclosure from your account after it is memorialized.</li>
